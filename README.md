Project Overview
This repository contains the completed Power BI analysis and dashboard for the Data Professional Survey Breakdown. The goal of this project was to clean, transform, and visualize a raw dataset gathered from a survey of data professionals across various roles and industries. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as salary distribution, job satisfaction, popular programming languages, and demographic information.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated
Data Transformation (Power Query M): Data cleaning, splitting columns (e.g., simplifying job titles and programming languages), handling nulls, and creating a numeric Average Salary column from ranged text data.

Data Modeling (DAX): Creating explicit measures for count, average, and filtering logic.

Data Visualization: Designing an engaging, multi-page dashboard using cards, bar charts, Treemaps, Gauge visuals, and Donut charts to convey complex data clearly.

Geographic Analysis: Mapping the distribution of survey respondents by country.

üöÄ Key Analysis Highlights
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the data professional landscape, revealing several critical insights:

Compensation & Roles (Dashboard 1)
Survey Participants: A total of 630 data professionals participated in the survey, with an average age of 29.87.
